"""
HYPERION structured event emitter — the observability spine.

Every significant pipeline event (LLM call, search, extraction, agent
transition, escalation) emits a structured event via ``trace()``.
Sinks receive these events in real-time:

- ``file_sink`` writes JSONL to ``reports/<engagement_id>/trace.jsonl``
- TUI sink renders a compact rolling view + status strip
- Future sinks: metrics aggregator, distributed trace exporter

This is NOT logging. Logging is for debugging. Tracing is for
observability — structured, typed events that feed dashboards,
regression gates, and cost/latency ledgers. (§II.9, D10)

Usage::

    from hyperion.obs import trace, add_sink, file_sink

    # At engagement start:
    add_sink(file_sink(engagement_id))

    # Anywhere in the pipeline:
    trace("llm", agent="synthesis_lead", tier="deep", provider="google",
          model="gemini-3.1-flash-lite", status="OK", took_ms=4200,
          prompt_tokens=12000, completion_tokens=3000)

HYPERION Engagement Director — Agent 1, the partner.

This is NOT a generic planner. This is the senior consulting partner who:
- Identifies the key question behind the question
- Knows which frameworks apply (and which don't)
- Anticipates which findings will change the analysis direction
- Adjusts team composition in real-time when new information emerges

The Engagement Director is the entry point for every engagement. It
receives the business question, decomposes it into research domains,
selects the right specialists (not all 12 — only the ones that matter
for this question), builds a dependency graph, assigns model tiers
based on complexity and budget, and dispatches to the AgentBus.

During execution, it monitors the bus for ESCALATION messages and
adapts the plan mid-flight — spawning new agents, rerouting
dependencies, or reallocating tiers. This is adaptive replanning
(§10.2), and it is what makes HYPERION dynamic, not a fixed pipeline.

Model Tier: STRONG (Nemotron 3 Super 120B — planning requires strong reasoning)
Tools: All tools (read-only) — can see everything, modify nothing directly
Output: WorkflowDAG (Pydantic model with all task nodes, dependencies, tiers)

Methodology (§4.3, Agent 1):
1. Receive question + conversation context
2. Classify question type(s)
3. Query Second Brain for prior research on this topic
4. Decompose into 4-8 research domains
5. Select specialists for each domain
6. Build dependency graph (parallel vs sequential)
7. Assign model tiers per task
8. Estimate total LLM calls + token consumption
9. Dispatch to AgentBus
10. Monitor execution, adapt if needed

What makes it the best version of itself:
It doesn't just "plan." It thinks like a senior consulting partner — it
identifies the key question behind the question, knows which frameworks
apply, anticipates which findings will change the analysis direction,
and adjusts the team composition in real-time. A generic planner says
"research these 5 topics." The Engagement Director says "Market sizing
is the critical path — start it first and give it STRONG tier.
Competitive intelligence can run in parallel at STANDARD. Financial
depends on Market's TAM number, so queue it. If Regulatory finds a
compliance barrier, reroute to add a Legal Risk sub-task."

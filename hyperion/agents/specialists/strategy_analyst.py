"""
HYPERION Strategy Analyst — Agent 14, the strategic frameworks specialist.

This is NOT a generic "apply SWOT to everything" agent. This is a specialist
with 8 proprietary analytical frameworks:

- Porter's Five Forces: Analyze industry attractiveness through five forces.
  Score each force as strong/moderate/weak with specific rationale.
- BCG growth-share matrix: Plot products/business units as stars, cash cows,
  question marks, dogs. Identify resource allocation recommendations.
- SWOT analysis: Structured SWOT with the critical distinction that it's a
  snapshot, not a strategy. Convert SWOT into a TOWS matrix to generate
  strategic options (SO, WO, ST, WT strategies).
- Blue Ocean strategy: Create uncontested market space using the eliminate-
  reduce-raise-create framework. Build a strategy canvas.
- VRIO framework: Evaluate resources/capabilities on Value, Rarity,
  Imitability, and Organization. Identify sustainable competitive advantage.
- Core competence analysis: Identify the 2-3 core competencies. Assess
  defensibility and transferability.
- Strategic option grid: Build a grid of 3-5 strategic options, each scored
  on feasibility, impact, risk, time to value, and resource requirements.
- Game theory: Analyze competitive interactions (prisoner's dilemma,
  sequential games, signaling). Identify dominant strategies and Nash
  equilibria.

It doesn't apply every framework to every question. It selects the right
framework for the specific question — Porter's for industry attractiveness,
VRIO for resource-based strategy, Blue Ocean for market creation, game theory
for competitive dynamics. A generic strategist applies SWOT to everything.
The HYPERION Strategy Analyst applies the framework that actually illuminates
the specific question, and explicitly says why it chose that framework over
the alternatives. (§4.4, Agent 14)

Model Tier: STRONG (Nemotron 3 Super 120B — strategy requires the strongest
reasoning)
Tools: SearxNG, Jina, Obscura
Sub-agents: Max 3 — Porter's data, competitor moves, VRIO resources
Output: StrategyAnalysis (Five Forces, VRIO, SWOT/TOWS, strategic options,
        game theory)

Methodology (§4.4, Agent 14):
1. Search for strategic context (SearxNG + Jina)
2. Run Porter's Five Forces
3. Run VRIO on company resources
4. Build SWOT → TOWS matrix
5. Generate 3-5 strategic options
6. Score options on strategic option grid
7. Run game theory analysis on competitive dynamics
8. Produce StrategyAnalysis model

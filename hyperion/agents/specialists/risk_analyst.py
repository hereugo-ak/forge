HYPERION Risk Analyst — Agent 6, the risk identification and mitigation specialist.

This is NOT a generic "list the risks" agent. This is a specialist with 6
proprietary analytical frameworks:

- Risk matrix: 5×5 probability × impact grid with color-coded zones.
- Monte Carlo simulation: 10,000-trial simulations on key variables producing
  P10/P50/P90 probability distributions.
- Black swan analysis: Low-probability, high-impact events that could
  invalidate the entire strategy — risks that don't appear in the matrix
  because they're too unlikely, but if they happen, they're catastrophic.
- Scenario planning: Best/base/worst with trigger conditions, leading
  indicators, and response plans.
- Mitigation design: Specific action, assigned owner, residual risk.
- Residual risk scoring: Re-score after mitigation — some risks are fully
  mitigatable, others are inherent.

It thinks in scenarios, not in lists. A generic risk analyst lists 20 risks.
The HYPERION Risk Analyst identifies the 5 risks that actually matter,
explains why the other 15 are noise, and designs mitigations that are
specific enough to act on. It always asks "what would kill this?" before
asking "what could help this?" — because surviving the downside is more
important than capturing the upside. (§4.4, Agent 6)

Model Tier: STANDARD
Tools: SearxNG, Jina, Obscura
Sub-agents: Max 3 — historical failures, regulatory risks, technology/cyber risks
Output: RiskAnalysis (risks, top risks with mitigations, black swans,
        residual risk summary, scenario plan, confidence, sources)

Methodology (§4.4, Agent 6):
1. Search for known risks in the industry/space (SearxNG + Jina)
2. Scrape regulatory/sanctions databases (Obscura)
3. Identify risks across 6 categories: market, financial, operational,
   regulatory, technology, and strategic
4. Score each risk on probability × impact
5. Build risk matrix
6. Design mitigations for top 10 risks
7. Calculate residual risk scores
8. Identify black swan scenarios
9. Build scenario plan with triggers
10. Produce RiskAnalysis model

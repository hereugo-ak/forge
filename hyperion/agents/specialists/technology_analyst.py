HYPERION Technology Analyst — Agent 7, the technology evaluation specialist.

This is NOT a generic "compare tech stacks" agent. This is a specialist
with 6 proprietary analytical frameworks:

- Architecture review: Evaluates a technology architecture against business
  requirements (scalability, reliability, maintainability, cost). Identifies
  anti-patterns and single points of failure.
- Tech debt assessment: Quantifies technical debt using the SIG/TÜViT model
  or similar. Categorizes debt as intentional vs. unintentional, estimates
  remediation cost.
- Vendor evaluation: Scores vendors across 7 dimensions — feature fit,
  pricing, scalability, support quality, ecosystem, lock-in risk, and
  roadmap alignment. Produces a vendor comparison matrix.
- Build-vs-buy framework: Structured analysis comparing build vs. buy on
  time to market, 5-year TCO, strategic differentiation, maintenance burden,
  team capability, and opportunity cost.
- TCO analysis: 5-year total cost of ownership including licensing,
  infrastructure, maintenance, integration, and switching costs.
- Platform assessment: Evaluates platform play vs. point solution. Assesses
  API quality, integration ecosystem, and extensibility.

It evaluates tech against business requirements, not engineering preferences.
It doesn't recommend Kubernetes because it's "modern" — it recommends the
simplest technology that meets the scalability/reliability requirements. It
always calculates 5-year TCO, not just licensing cost. It always assesses
lock-in risk — a vendor that's 20% cheaper but impossible to leave is more
expensive than one that's 20% pricier but easy to switch. (§4.4, Agent 7)

Model Tier: STANDARD
Tools: SearxNG, Jina, Obscura
Sub-agents: Max 3 — vendor1 pricing/features, vendor2 pricing/features,
            developer reviews
Output: TechnologyAssessment (vendor matrix, build-vs-buy, TCO analysis,
        architecture review, platform assessment, lock-in risk, confidence,
        sources)

Methodology (§4.4, Agent 7):
1. Search for vendor/technology options (SearxNG + Jina)
2. Scrape vendor pricing and feature pages (Obscura)
3. Search for developer sentiment and reviews (SearxNG)
4. Build vendor comparison matrix
5. Run build-vs-buy analysis
6. Calculate 5-year TCO
7. Assess architecture if applicable
8. Produce TechnologyAssessment model

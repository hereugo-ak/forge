"""
HYPERION Market Analyst — Agent 3, the market sizing specialist.

This is NOT a generic "research the market" agent. This is a specialist
with proprietary analytical frameworks that no other agent has:

- Top-down market sizing: Global SaaS → India SaaS → India Tier-2 SaaS
- Bottom-up market sizing: 50M businesses × 2% adoption × $500 ARPU = $500M
- CAGR triangulation: Cross-validate estimates from different sources
- Market maturity assessment: emerging/growing/mature/declining
- Growth driver decomposition: population × penetration × ARPU × new use cases
- Segment analysis: demographics, behavior, psychographics → entry point

It NEVER reports a single market size number. It always reports a range
with top-down, bottom-up, and triangulated estimates. It always cites
the source for each number. It always flags when market data is sparse.
It always segments before sizing — a market size without segmentation
is useless for strategy. (§4.4, Agent 3)

Model Tier: STANDARD (GPT OSS 120B on Groq primary, Nemotron 3 Nano 30B backup)
Tools: SearxNG, Jina, Obscura, Alpha Vantage, FRED
Sub-agents: Max 3 — TAM data, geography spending, adoption/penetration rates
Output: MarketAnalysis (TAM range, SAM, SOM, CAGR, segments, growth drivers,
        market maturity, confidence, sources)

Methodology (§4.4, Agent 3):
1. Search for existing market reports (SearxNG + Jina)
2. If no direct data, scrape interactive dashboards (Obscura)
3. Pull macroeconomic context (FRED)
4. Pull public company revenue data for market sizing (Alpha Vantage)
5. Apply top-down sizing
6. Apply bottom-up sizing
7. Cross-validate via CAGR triangulation
8. Segment the market
9. Identify growth drivers
10. Produce structured MarketAnalysis model

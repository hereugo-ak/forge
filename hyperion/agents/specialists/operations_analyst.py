"""
HYPERION Operations Analyst — Agent 8, the process optimization specialist.

This is NOT a generic "map the process" agent. This is a specialist with 7
proprietary analytical frameworks:

- Process mapping: SIPOC (Supplier-Input-Process-Output-Customer) and value
  stream mapping. Identifies non-value-adding steps.
- Lean/Six Sigma: Eliminate waste (Lean) and reduce variation (Six Sigma).
  Calculate process sigma level and DPMO (defects per million opportunities).
- Bottleneck analysis: Theory of constraints. Calculate throughput at each
  stage and identify the binding constraint.
- Supply chain mapping: Raw materials to end customer. Identify single-source
  suppliers, geographic concentration risks, and lead time vulnerabilities.
- Capacity planning: Current capacity utilization, capacity constraints, and
  expansion scenarios.
- Operational KPI design: Not generic metrics — the 5-7 metrics that actually
  drive performance for this specific operational model.
- Efficiency benchmarking: Benchmark against industry leaders. Identify the
  gap and estimate the improvement potential.

It doesn't just map processes — it identifies the binding constraint and
estimates the improvement potential in dollars. A generic ops analyst says
"the process has bottlenecks." The HYPERION Operations Analyst says "Step 3
is the bottleneck at 40 units/hour vs. 60 units/hour for the rest of the
process. Adding one worker to Step 3 costs $50K/year but increases throughput
by 50%, generating $200K/year in additional contribution margin. ROI = 300%."
(§4.4, Agent 8)

Model Tier: STANDARD
Tools: SearxNG, Jina, Obscura
Sub-agents: Max 3 — operational benchmarks, supply chain data, efficiency metrics
Output: OperationsAnalysis (process map, bottlenecks, capacity, benchmarks,
        KPI dashboard, improvement opportunities, total improvement value,
        confidence, sources)

Methodology (§4.4, Agent 8):
1. Search for operational data and benchmarks (SearxNG + Jina)
2. Map the end-to-end process
3. Identify bottlenecks
4. Calculate capacity utilization
5. Benchmark against industry leaders
6. Identify improvement opportunities (Lean/Six Sigma)
7. Design KPI dashboard
8. Produce OperationsAnalysis model

"""
HYPERION M&A Analyst — Agent 12, the mergers & acquisitions specialist.

This is NOT a generic "find acquisition targets" agent. This is a specialist
with 6 proprietary analytical frameworks:

- Target identification: Screen for acquisition targets using criteria:
  strategic fit, size, geography, technology, talent, customer base. Build a
  long list (20-50) and short list (5-10) with rationale for each.
- Synergy analysis: Quantify revenue synergies (cross-sell, upsell, new
  markets) and cost synergies (headcount reduction, facility consolidation,
  procurement savings). ALWAYS with a reality discount — synergies rarely
  materialize at 100% of the estimate. 50-70% of estimated synergies typically
  materialize.
- Integration planning: Build a 100-day integration plan with workstreams,
  milestones, owners, and risk flags. Identify the top 3 integration risks.
- Valuation gap analysis: Compare the acquirer's maximum acceptable price to
  the target's minimum acceptable price. Identify the zone of possible
  agreement.
- Accretion/dilution analysis: Model the impact of the acquisition on the
  acquirer's EPS over 1-3 years. Identify whether the deal is accretive or
  dilutive and under what conditions.
- Cultural fit assessment: Evaluate cultural compatibility using public data
  (Glassdoor reviews, LinkedIn company pages, employee sentiment). Cultural
  mismatch is the #1 reason M&A deals fail to deliver synergies.

It always applies a reality discount to synergies — 50-70% of estimated
synergies typically materialize. It always assesses cultural fit because that's
the #1 failure cause. It always builds an integration plan, not just a deal
rationale — because the deal is the easy part, integration is the hard part.
(§4.4, Agent 12)

Model Tier: STRONG (Nemotron 3 Super 120B — M&A analysis is complex and
requires strong reasoning)
Tools: SearxNG, Jina, Obscura, Alpha Vantage
Sub-agents: Max 3 — target screening, financials pull, cultural reviews
Output: MAAnalysis (target list, synergy analysis, accretion/dilution,
        cultural fit, integration plan)

Methodology (§4.4, Agent 12):
1. Define acquisition criteria with Engagement Director
2. Search for potential targets (SearxNG + Jina + Obscura)
3. Build long list → short list
4. Pull financial data for targets (Alpha Vantage)
5. Run synergy analysis
6. Run accretion/dilution
7. Assess cultural fit
8. Build integration plan
9. Produce M&AAnalysis model

HYPERION Sustainability Analyst — Agent 10, the ESG and sustainability specialist.

This is NOT a generic "calculate carbon footprint" agent. This is a specialist
with 5 proprietary analytical frameworks:

- ESG scoring: Score the company/strategy on ESG frameworks: MSCI ESG Ratings,
  SASB standards, TCFD recommendations, GRI standards. Identify which framework
  is most relevant for the stakeholder audience. Investors want TCFD, regulators
  want CSRD, customers want GRI.
- Carbon footprint: Calculate Scope 1 (direct), Scope 2 (purchased electricity),
  and Scope 3 (value chain) emissions. Identify the specific emission sources
  that account for 80% of the footprint and calculate the abatement cost for
  each. Not just 'energy use' — 'electricity from coal-fired grid power, 5000
  MWh/yr, 2500 tCO2e, abatement: switch to renewable PPA at $20/tCO2e, total
  cost $50K/yr.'
- Sustainability reporting: Map reporting requirements (CSRD, SEC climate, TCFD,
  CDP). Identify which reports are mandatory vs. voluntary and the penalty for
  non-compliance.
- Green financing: Evaluate green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and carbon
  credit opportunities. Calculate potential financing cost savings — not just
  'green bonds exist' but 'a $50M green bond at 3.5% vs. 4.5% conventional saves
  $500K/yr in interest.'
- Circular economy: Assess opportunities for circular economy models (reduce,
  reuse, recycle, refurbish) in the business model. Each opportunity has a $
  value and implementation cost.

It doesn't just calculate a carbon number — it identifies the specific emission
sources that account for 80% of the footprint and calculates the abatement cost
for each. It maps ESG to financial impact (green financing savings, regulatory
penalty avoidance, investor access) not just to compliance. It always identifies
which ESG framework matters for the specific stakeholder (investors want TCFD,
regulators want CSRD, customers want GRI). (§4.4, Agent 10)

Model Tier: STANDARD
Tools: SearxNG, Jina, Obscura, FRED
Sub-agents: Max 3 — ESG ratings, carbon emission data, sustainability regulations
Output: SustainabilityAnalysis (ESG scores, carbon footprint with abatement costs,
        reporting requirements, green financing opportunities, circular economy,
        total savings, financial impact summary, confidence, sources)

Methodology (§4.4, Agent 10):
1. Search for ESG data and ratings (SearxNG + Jina)
2. Scrape ESG rating platforms (Obscura)
3. Pull environmental economic data (FRED)
4. Score on relevant ESG framework
5. Calculate carbon footprint (Scope 1/2/3)
6. Map reporting requirements
7. Identify green financing opportunities
8. Produce SustainabilityAnalysis model

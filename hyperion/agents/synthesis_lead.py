"""
HYPERION Synthesis Lead — Agent 2, the senior consultant.

This is NOT a summarizer. This is the most intellectually demanding role
in the system. The Synthesis Lead:

- Holds 4-6 specialists' findings in mind simultaneously (DEEP tier,
  250K context window)
- Identifies contradictions between agents (data conflict, interpretation
  conflict, scope conflict)
- Resolves contradictions evidence-weighted, NOT by averaging
- Calibrates system-level confidence (weakest critical link dominates)
- Produces a coherent narrative synthesis with a clear recommendation

A summarizer lists what each agent found. A synthesizer says "Market says
$2B TAM, Financial says too small, but Financial's model assumes 5%
penetration while Market's data supports 12% — at 12% penetration the
market is viable. The recommendation is ENTER, with the critical
assumption being penetration rate. If penetration falls below 8%, the
recommendation flips to NO-GO." That is synthesis. (§4.3, Agent 2)

Model Tier: DEEP (Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite — 250K context window for
holding all findings simultaneously)
Tools: Second Brain (retrieve prior engagements for pattern matching),
       all specialist findings (read-only via AgentBus)
Sub-agents: Max 1 — for contradiction resolution deep dives
Output: FinalReport (the single most important data structure in HYPERION)

Methodology (§4.3, Agent 2):
1. Collect all specialist findings from AgentBus
2. Build a finding matrix (agent × finding × evidence × confidence)
3. Identify contradictions and classify them
4. Resolve contradictions (evidence-weighted, not averaging)
5. Identify the critical path to the recommendation
6. Draft the recommendation with supporting evidence chain
7. Calibrate system confidence level
8. Produce FinalReport model

Quality Gate Loop:
After producing FinalReport, the Quality Gate scores it on a 10-dimension
rubric. If score < 4.0, the Synthesis Lead receives specific gap feedback
and iterates — up to 3 times max. Each iteration targets the specific
dimensions that scored below 4. This is NOT a generic "try again" — it
is targeted refinement based on actionable feedback. (§4.5, Agent 18)

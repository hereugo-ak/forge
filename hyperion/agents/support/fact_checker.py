HYPERION Fact Checker — Agent 16, the verification engine and hallucination catcher.

This is NOT a generic "check if sources exist" agent. This is a specialist with
5 proprietary skills:

- Claim verification: Extract specific factual claims from specialist findings
  and verify each against independent sources. A claim is VERIFIED if 2+
  independent sources agree. Not just "does a source exist" — "do 2+
  independent sources confirm this specific claim?"
- Source credibility scoring: Score each source on credibility and weight
  verification accordingly. A claim verified by a peer-reviewed paper is more
  credible than one verified by a blog post. Uses the same credibility
  hierarchy as the Research Librarian.
- Contradiction detection: Identify when two specialists make contradictory
  claims and flag them for the Synthesis Lead. Not just "they disagree" —
  classify the contradiction (DATA_CONFLICT, INTERPRETATION_CONFLICT,
  SCOPE_CONFLICT) and flag it with both agents' claims.
- Evidence chain validation: For each claim, trace the evidence chain:
  claim → source → original data. If the chain breaks (source doesn't contain
  the data, or data doesn't support the claim), flag it. This catches
  hallucinated citations — the #1 quality risk in LLM-generated reports.
- Statistical sanity checks: Check for statistical red flags: numbers that
  are too round (suspicious), growth rates that are implausibly high, market
  sizes that don't reconcile across agents. Not just "is this number right" —
  "is this number suspicious given the context?"

It runs on FAST tier (GPT OSS 120B on Cerebras, ~3000 tok/s) because fact-
checking is time-critical — it runs in parallel with late-stage specialists
and must finish before the Synthesis Lead starts. It doesn't just check if a
source exists — it checks if the source actually contains the data the
specialist claims it does. It catches hallucinated citations, which is the
#1 quality risk in LLM-generated reports. (§4.5, Agent 16)

Model Tier: FAST (GPT OSS 120B on Cerebras — speed is critical, fact-checking
runs in parallel with late-stage specialists)
Tools: SearxNG (search for verification), Jina (extract source content to
       verify against original), Obscura (scrape JS-rendered pages for
       verification)
Sub-agents: 0 (support agent — doesn't spawn sub-agents)
Output: FactCheckReport (claim-by-claim verification status, contradictions,
        evidence chain validation, statistical red flags)

Methodology (§4.5, Agent 16):
1. Collect all specialist findings from AgentBus
2. Extract factual claims (numbers, dates, names, events)
3. For each claim, search for verification (SearxNG + Jina)
4. Score each claim: VERIFIED, PLAUSIBLE, UNVERIFIED, CONTRADICTED
5. Flag contradictions to Synthesis Lead
6. Flag unverified claims to originating specialist
7. Produce FactCheckReport model

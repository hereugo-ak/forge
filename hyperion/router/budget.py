"""
HYPERION Daily Budget Planner — tracks RPD across all models per provider.

This is NOT a generic budget tracker. This is the system that ensures we
never exhaust a provider's daily quota before the engagement is complete.
It allocates requests based on urgency, preserves a 20% reserve on every
provider for critical end-of-engagement tasks, and tracks daily consumption
in real-time. (§3.5)

Provider daily budgets (total RPD across all models):
- Google: ~29,460 RPD (Gemma 14.4K + Gemma 14.4K + Gemini 500 + reserves)
- Groq: ~18,400 RPD (6 models x ~1K-14.4K each)
- NVIDIA: ~1,000 credits/month -> ~33/day (scarce — reserve for STRONG/DEEP)
- Cerebras: 1M TPD per model -> effectively unlimited by tokens, but 5 RPM

Allocation strategy:
- High urgency (quality gate, synthesis): use high-RPD providers first
  (Google Gemma, Groq Llama 3.1 8B) to preserve NVIDIA credits
- Normal (research, analysis): balanced selection across all providers
- Low (background tasks): use NVIDIA sparingly, prefer Google/Groq
- 20% reserve: preserved on every provider for critical end-of-engagement
  tasks (Quality Gate scoring, Synthesis Lead reconciliation, final render)

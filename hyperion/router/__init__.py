"""
HYPERION Router — the LLM routing layer.

This is NOT a generic LLM client wrapper. This is the predictive wait gate
system that tracks RPM/TPM/RPD across 4 providers in real-time sliding
windows and routes requests to avoid 429s before they happen. (§3)

The router is infrastructure, not intelligence. Agents don't know which
provider they're using — they request a tier and the router decides.
(§9, key design decisions)

Components:
- providers/base.py: BaseProvider — common interface for all 4 providers
- providers/google.py: Google AI Studio (Gemma, Gemini)
- providers/nvidia.py: NVIDIA NIM (Nemotron)
- providers/cerebras.py: Cerebras (GPT OSS 120B)
- providers/groq.py: Groq (Llama, GPT OSS)
- wait_gate.py: SlidingWindowTracker, WaitGate coordinator
- budget.py: DailyBudgetPlanner with 20% reserve
- estimator.py: Token estimation + calibration
- router.py: LLMRouter — async, TPM-aware, singleton
